# Structs and Classes Lab - 2


## Question 1

Using the Room struct below, write code that demonstrates that it is a value type.

```swift
struct Room {
let maxOccupancy: Int
let length: Double
let width: Double
}
```
Answer:
```swift
struct Room {
let maxOccupancy: Int
var length: Double
let width: Double
}

var someRoom = Room(maxOccupancy: 2, length: 30.0, width: 25.0)

var someRoomCopy = someRoom
someRoom.length = 35.0

print(someRoomCopy.length) //30.0 Original value
print(someRoom.length)     //35.0 Even though the length was reassigned, it does not change the copy of someRoom's value for length
```

## Question 2

Using the Bike class below, write code that demonstrates that it is a reference type.

```swift
class Bike {
var wheelNumber = 2
var hasBell = false
}
```
```swift
class Bike {
var wheelNumber = 2
var hasBell = false
}

var newBike = Bike()
var a = newBike

newBike.wheelNumber = 5
print(a.wheelNumber)    //5 even though a was an instance with a value of newBike, a still refers to the proeprties in the class newBike.
```

## Question 3

a. Given the Animal class below, create a Bird subclass with a new `canFly` property.

```swift
class Animal {
var name: String = ""
var printDescription() {
print("I am an animal named \(name)")
}
}
```

b. Override the printDescription method to have the instance of the Bird object print out its name and whether it can fly

```swift
//a.
class Animal {
var name: String = ""

func printDescription() {
print("I am an animal named \(name)")
}

init(name: String) {
self.name = name
}
}

//b.
class Bird: Animal {
var canFly: Bool

init(name: String, canFly: Bool) {
self.canFly = canFly
super.init(name: name)
}

override func printDescription() {
if canFly == true {
print("I am an animal named \(name) and I can fly!")
} else {
print("I am an animal named \(name) and I cannot fly!")
}
}

}

var penguin = Bird(name: "Penguin", canFly: false)
penguin.printDescription()
```

## Question 4

```swift
class Bike {
let wheelNumber = 2
let wheelWidth = 1.3
var hasBell = true
func ringBell() {
if hasBell {
print("Ring!")
}
}
}
```
a. Create a LoudBike subclass of Bike. When you call ringBell it should ring the bell in all caps.

b. Give LoudBike a new method called ringBell(times:) that rings the bell a given number of times

Answer:
```swift
class Bike {
let wheelNumber = 2
let wheelWidth = 1.3
var hasBell = true

func ringBell() {
if hasBell {
print("Ring!")
}
}
}

class LoudBike: Bike {
override func ringBell() {
if hasBell {
print("RING!!!")
}
}

func ringBell(times: Int) {
for _ in 1...times {
ringBell()
}
}

}

var myLoudBike = LoudBike()
myLoudBike.ringBell(times: 3)
```


## Question 5

Answer (a, b, c, d, e):
```swift
class Shape {
var name: String { return "This is a generic shape" }
var area: Double { fatalError("Subclasses must override the area") }
var perimeter: Double { fatalError("Subclasses must override the perimeter") }
}

//square subclass
class Square: Shape {
var sideLength = 5
override var name: String { return """
Square
Area: \(area)
Perimeter: \(perimeter)
""" }
override var area: Double {
get {
return Double(sideLength*sideLength)
}
}
override var perimeter: Double {
get {
return Double(sideLength*4)
}
}
}

var square = Square()
print(square.name)

//rectangle subclass
class Rectangle: Shape {
var width = 6
var height = 4

override var name: String { return """
Rectangle
Area: \(area)
Perimeter: \(perimeter)
""" }
override var area: Double {
get {
return Double(width*height)
}
}
override var perimeter: Double {
get {
return Double((width*2)+(height*2))
}
}
}
var rectangle = Rectangle()
print(rectangle.name)
```

a. Given the `Shape` object above, create a subclass `Square` with a property `sideLength` with a default value of 5.

b. Override the `area` and `perimeter` computed values so the return the area/perimeter of the square as appropriate

c. Override the `name` property of `Square` so that it returns a String containing its name ("Square") and its area and perimeter

d. Create a class `Rectangle` that subclasses from `Shape`.  Give it a `width` property with a default value of 6 and a `height` property with a default value of 4

e. Override the `name` property of `Rectangle` so that it returns a String containing its name ("Rectangle") and its area and perimeter.

f. (BONUS) What happens when you run the code below?  Explain why.

```swift
var myShapes = [Shape]()

myShapes.append(Square())
myShapes.append(Rectangle())

for shape in myShapes {
print("This is a \(shape.name) with an area of \(shape.area) and a perimeter of \(shape.perimeter)")
}
```

Answer: We created a variable called myShapes which is an empty array of the type Shape. We then appended the class Square and class Rectangle into the array, which works because they are both subclasses of Shape and therefore can be treated as if they were a type Shape. The for loop then iterates through the myShapes array and prints out a string with the shape name, area, and perimiter interpolated for each shape.

## Question 6

a. Given the Point object below, complete the `distance` method so that it returns the distance between a given point.

The equation for the distance formula can be found [here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/distance-2-points.html) and is give by:

```swift
let horizontalDistance = pointOneXValue - pointTwoXValue
let verticalDistance = pointOneYValue - pointTwoYValue
let distanceBetweenTwoPoints = sqrt(horizontalDistance * horizontalDistance + verticalDistance * verticalDistance)
```

`sqrt` is a method in Swift that gives the square root.  Make sure to have `import Foundation` or `import UIKit` to use this method.


b. Given the above Point object, and Circle object below, add a `contains` method that returns whether or not a given point is on the circle

c. Add another method to `Circle` that returns a random point on the circle

Hint: Given the radius of a circle and the x value of a point on the circle, the y value of the point is defined by:

```
âˆš(r^2) - (x^2)
```

```swift
circleOne.contains(circleOne.getRandomPoint()) //Should always be true
```

Answer (a, b, c):
```swift
struct Point {
let x: Double
let y: Double

func distance(to point: Point) -> Double {
let horizontalDistance = self.x - point.x
let verticalDistance = self.y - point.y
return sqrt(pow(horizontalDistance, 2.0) + pow(verticalDistance, 2.0))
}
}

let pointOne = Point(x: 0, y: 0)
let pointTwo = Point(x: 10, y: 10)

print(pointOne.distance(to: pointTwo)) //Prints 14.142135623730951


struct Circle {
let radius: Double
let center: Point

func contains(_ point: Point) -> Bool {
    return center.distance(to: point) == radius
}


func getRandomPoint() -> Point {
let xRandom = Double.random(in: 0...self.radius)
let yRandom = sqrt(pow(radius,2) - pow(xRandom,2) )
let randomPoint = Point(x: xRandom,
y: yRandom)
return randomPoint
}

}




let pointOne = Point(x: 0, y: 0)
let circleOne = Circle(radius: 5, center: pointOne)
let pointTwo = Point(x: 5, y: 0)
let pointThree = Point(x: 4, y: 0)
let pointFour = Point(x: sqrt(12.5), y: sqrt(12.5))
circleOne.contains(pointTwo) //true
circleOne.contains(pointThree) // false
circleOne.contains(pointFour) //true


circleOne.contains(circleOne.getRandomPoint()) //Should always be true

```




## Question 7

a. Create a struct called HangmanModel with 3 properties `targetWord: String`, `numberOfIncorrectGuesses: Int` and `guessedLetters: [Character]`.

b. Add a method called `playerWon` that returns whether all of the characters in `targetWord` are in `guessedLetters`

```swift
var model = HangmanModel()
model.targetWord = "hello"
model.guessedLetters = ["h","e","o","l"]
model.playerWon //true
```

c. Add a method called `printDisplayVersionOfWord` that prints the `targetWord` replacing characters that are not in `guessedLetters` with "\_"

```
var model = HangmanModel()
model.targetWord = "hello"
model.guessedLetters = ["h","l"]
model.printDisplayVersionOfWord
//prints h_ll_
```

d. Add a method called `guess(_:)` that takes in a character as input, and updates `guessedLetters` and `numberOfIncorrectGuesses` as appropriate.

```swift
var model = HangmanModel()
model.targetWord = "hello"
model.guess("h")
model.guess("a")
model.guessedLetters // ["h", "a"]
model.numberOfIncorrectGuesses // 1
```

e. Have `guess(_:)` also print out the current display version of the word, the number of incorrect guesses and if the player has won.
